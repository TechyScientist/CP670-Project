# CP670 Project: Course Registration App
Submiited in partial completion of CP670-23SP in fufillment of Master of Computer Science degree
requirements at Wilfrid Laurier University.

### Project Statement
Students should be able to register for or withdraw from courses at their institution in a 
mobile-friendly app. Institutions usually have a web site for students to register for courses, 
but these web sites are typically not fully optimized for the mobile platform.

### Project Objectives
The project will allow student users to register for courses, withdraw from courses, view current 
and past courses, and view details of courses (descriptions, prerequisites, exclusions, and course 
and waitlist seat information) Students will also be able to track their course completion progress 
to show their degree completion progress.

Administrators will be able to add or remove terms, courses and students into the app. 
All administrator functions are protected with an administrator username and password that would
not be given to student users.

### Stakeholders
University Students – This will be the group of users that will be using the app most often. They 
will be able to use the app to update their registration status (i.e., adding or removing courses) 
and keeping track of their degree progress (like Laurier’s MyDegree site). Students will also be
able to view their course schedule for a term (i.e., a list of courses and their days/time, not a 
visual schedule like Laurier’s ScheduleMe site)

University Administrators – This group of users will use the app less often, only to add, modify or
delete courses or users. In an ideal situation, the app would connect with the course information 
system and would not need administrators to manually add items to it.

Perspective Students and Academic Advisors – This group is placed here to further expand the 
userbase for the app. Perspective students and academic advisors can use the app to view a term’s
course offerings so they can read about a specific course.

### Project Deliverables
The final app will give student users the ability to view and modify their registration status and 
degree progress as well as view courses listed in a particular term and their details in a
mobile-friendly environment. The app will also provide administrative users the ability to add or
delete students, courses or academic terms.

### Disclaimer
The app is intended to integrate with Laurier’s registration and Student Information System, LORIS,
but for the scope of this class would not be integrated with it. Instead, it would carry out the
same functions as LORIS instead of affecting the LORIS database. The app represents a 
“proof-of-concept” of an app that would work alongside the LORIS web system that is currently
implemented.
